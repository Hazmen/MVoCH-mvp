Hello, whoever is reading this text.

This repository is the mvp version of the Mathematical Visualization of Collatz Hypothesis (MVoCH mvp) project, which aims to create the basic logic of the site - calculation using the 3n+1 formula.

If you are not familiar with this mathematical problem, I strongly advise you to watch the Youtube video from the scientific popularization channel Veritasium (Vert Dider if you are Russian),
since I plan to implement many graphs and visualizations from this video during the project - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgzBDZwanWA 

What the MVP can do at the time of writing the README (November 22, 2025):

- The ability to enter numbers of unlimited length and the ability to start calculating
- Slider that regulates the rate of gradual appearance of calculation results in the sim-area (1x - 5x)
- Sim-area that displays a list of spisok in the field with the numbering of each step
- Ability to copy calculation results (text and step indexes are not copied)
- Two blocks for displaying information:
- Current number, which outputs the last number that appeared
- Statistical, which displays in real time the number of steps and the largest number obtained during the calculation

What is the future purpose of this project?:
-The opportunity to visually and interactively show how the Collatz hypothesis works, what it consists of, and show "All its beauty", including its history since its inception, its place in the mathematical community.
- A material for professors and teachers of mathematics that allows students to learn in detail and visually about this hypothesis, largely due to its simplicity.

What am I (we, if there are new members in the team) going to implement in the project in the future:
About 4+ calculation data visualization modes (Card sequential mode, linear, logarithmic and other graph modes, and other modes that will be created based on the visualizations in the video from Veritasium (link above)
Optimization to enable simulation on mobile devices
Interactivity
Good graphics
Calculation parameters

And etc...
